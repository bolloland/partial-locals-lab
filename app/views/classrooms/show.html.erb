Classroom Info

WHY THIS?         @classroom is called in #show, local isn't. WHy is this here?
<%= render partial: "classroom", locals: {classroom: @classroom} %> WHY!?

<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
    <%= render partial: "students/student", locals: {student: student} %>
<% end %>
#Why can't I use |s| in my iteration?
